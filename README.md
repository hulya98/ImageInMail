# ImageInMail
Some mail applications(outloog,gmail) don't allow to put image of mail text body. But If you use RazorLight, you can arrange image to mail body.
By the way, some mail applications don't support some css codes so first of all, you can use inline css not <style> tags. In my method, I convert <style> tags to inline css. This is the functionality of RazorLight.
